        <h1>Buttons</h1>
        <p>This is the list of buttons and what each one does with respect to the turtle and the canvas.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dance Button</li>
            <p>
                Clicking the Dance button will make the turtle dance in it's current location, first by spinning clockwise, then
                anti-clockwise, moving side-to-side, then up and down, and finally a last clockwise spin.
            </p>

            <li>Sleep Button</li>
            <p>
                Clicking the Sleep button will make the turtle close its eyes then fall asleep, with z's appearing above
                the turtle's head whilst he sleeps.
            </p>

            <li>Walk Button</li>
            <p>
                Clicking the Walk button makes the turtle walk in a square of length and width 200px with the centre of the
                square in the turtle's current position at the time of clicking.
            </p>

            <li>Reset Button</li>
            <p>Clicking the Reset button will reset all of the canvas' assets to the original positions.</p>
        </ul>

        <h1>Clicking the Canvas</h1>
        <p>
            This is the list of different actions when clicking various parts of the canvas and what each
            does with respect to the turtle and the canvas.
         </p>
         <ul>
             <li>Click on Turtle Shell</li>
             <p>
                 Clicking the turtle's shell will make the turtle go inside his shell, or if already inside his shell he will
                 come out of his shell.
             </p>

             <li>Click on Turtle Head/Body</li>
             <p>
                 Clicking the turtle's head or body will turn the turtle into a laser turtle, which will shoot lasers out of
                 his eyes and he'll do a full clockwise turn shooting his lasers.
             </p>

             <li>Click anywhere else on canvas</li>
             <p>
                 Clicking anywhere else on the canvas will make the turtle rotate to that position and then walk towards it.
             </p>
         </ul>
    </main>
</body>
